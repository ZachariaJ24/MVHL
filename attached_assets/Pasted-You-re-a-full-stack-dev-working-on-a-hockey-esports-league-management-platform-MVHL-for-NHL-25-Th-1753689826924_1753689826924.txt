You’re a full-stack dev working on a hockey esports league management platform (MVHL) for NHL 25. The system includes an Admin Panel, Player Panel, Team Management system, and full public-facing website.

⚠️ Fix these issues in the Admin Panel:

1. **User Management**
   - Cannot update user roles or assign them to teams.

2. **Team Management**
   - Cannot edit teams or sync changes.
   - Roster actions do not work.
   - Lineup "Save" button does not save lineups.
   - No Salary Breakdown implemented in the Finances tab.
   - Trades page, Reports page, and Schedule page do not load.
   - Add new tabs:  
     a. **Player Availability Tab** — pulls data from player panel  
     b. **Contract Negotiation Tab** — 1 contract offer per team, trade clause toggle, dollar format  
     c. **Waivers Tab** — Waived players claimable by teams for 30 mins, then open to others for 8 hrs  
     d. **Team Management Chat** — visible to GM, AGM, Owner, marked with a ⭐ next to names  

3. **Draft Control**
   - Only works from Draft Central.
   - Draft countdown does not function.
   - No team-based draft room or countdown UI in the panel.
   - Team draft room should display: who’s on the clock, recent picks, team draft chat.

4. **Player Panel**
   - "Availability → Save Changes" does nothing — backend should persist data.
   - No effect on Manager-side availability views.

5. **Schedule & Stats Management**
   - Cannot test due to lack of completed matches — create dummy data or add backend error handling.

6. **Image Uploader**
   - Doesn’t upload or sync images to intended areas.

7. **News Generator**
   - Fails every time — ensure content gets created and saved to DB.

8. **Player Lookup (Chel Stats)**
   - Returns "Player not found or error retrieving stats" — fix gamertag validation & external API call.

9. **Draft Area**
   - Team chat doesn’t work.
   - No interface for making picks.
   - No draft clock countdown or turn indicator.
